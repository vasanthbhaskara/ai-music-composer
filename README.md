# 🎵 AI Music Composer

An interactive neural network that composes original music in real time using a character-level LSTM trained on symbolic music notation.

👉 **Live demo:** https://ai-music-lab.streamlit.app

This project explores sequence modeling and generative AI by treating music as a language modeling problem. The system learns the grammar of ABC music notation and generates new compositions token-by-token.

## ✨ Features

- 🎼 Real-time AI music composition
- 🎚 Creativity control via temperature scaling
- 📏 Adjustable composition length
- 🎧 Built-in audio playback
- 🌈 Live animated audio visualizer
- ⬇ Download generated music
- 🌐 Interactive Streamlit web interface

---

## 🧠 Model Overview

The model is a character-level LSTM trained on ~800 folk songs in ABC notation.

Architecture:

```
Input tokens
→ Embedding (256)
→ LSTM (hidden size 1024)
→ Linear projection
→ Softmax sampling
```

Key ideas:

- Music treated as next-token prediction
- Sliding window batching
- Cross-entropy loss
- Multinomial sampling for generation
- Temperature scaling to control creativity

Conceptually similar to language modeling, but applied to musical structure.
